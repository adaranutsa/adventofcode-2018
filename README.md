## WARNING

If you're taking part in Advent of Code 2018, keep in mind that the code contained in this repository will give away the solution to the puzzle problem. If you're interested in solving it on your own, please do not look at my code.

## Why this repository?

I decided to challenge myself this year by improving my coding skills and digging deeper into Python. I discovered Advent of Code and decided to perform the challenges. This repository is here for me to keep track of my progress as I advance through the challenges as well as a place to showcase my work.
